_From a new terminal window (Ctrl + Alt + T):

cd Documents/fuego-server/fuego_server
python live_fuego.py
#OLD python all_cam_moving_smoke.py


**IMPORTANT NOTE if you have recently retrained the network: Retraining the network will result in retrained_graph.pb and retrained_labels.txt being created (or overwritten) inside /home/fuego/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining. 
If you want to use your new network in the form of server_reconstructed.py, copy the two files into the folder: /home/fuego/Documents/fuego-server/fuego_server 

TROUBLESHOOTING:
-If an error about CUDA drivers appears in the terminal window, try restarting the computer. A more permanent fix is necessary, but this often works.
